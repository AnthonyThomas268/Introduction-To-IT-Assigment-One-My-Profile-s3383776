        <h3>Interest in Information Technology</h3>
					<p>My interest in IT started in a rather indirect way and was not a very direct path. In 2012, I started studying an Associate Degree in Mechanical Engineering at RMIT after graduating high school. After initially deciding I immensely disliked Mechanical Engineering, I decided to double down and start yet another Associate degree in Civil  Engineering. I graduated after four years with two Engineering Degrees, and by this point, I had confirmed that Engineering was probably not something I enjoyed.</p>
