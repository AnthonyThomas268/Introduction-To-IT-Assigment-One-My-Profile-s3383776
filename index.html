        <h3>Interest in Information Technology</h3>
					<p>My interest in IT started in a round about way, I started studying an Associate Degree in Mechanical Engineering at RMIT in 2012 after graduating high school. After two years of study I managed to confirm that I immensely dislike Mechanical Engineering. So, I decided to double down and start another Associate degree in Civil Engineering. After another two years of study I graduated with two Associate Degrees and had confirmed that Engineering may not be the sort of thing I enjoy.</p>
          		<p> After graduating I lived abroad in Asia, Europe and most recently, North America, where I was working in the Canadian Rockies at a backcountry lodge, taking people on hiking tours in summer and cross-country skiing in winter. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, I decided to return to Australia when the company I was working for was forced to close its doors and could no longer sponsor my visa. </p>
              		<p> When I was living in Hanoi, working as an English teacher was where my interest in IT was first sparked. The community of expats in my area were a mix of different professionals, and a small group of them worked in IT; Programmers, Web developers, and other consultants who all had the ability to work remotely and travel to different parts of the world. Seeing the freedom their roles allowed them was very intriguing and I began to consider the possibility of  a future in IT. </p>
                  		<p> When I had to relocate back to Melbourne this year, a friend suggested that I apply for an entry level job at their Telcom company, Aussie Broadband. Despite having very little knowledge and no experience in the industry I got a Customer service Sales position. Shortly after starting I was transitioned to working remotely in response to the growing COVID-19 restrictions. Working from home reminded me of the expats in Hanoi, some of who have continued living abroad throughout the pandemic and have managed to maintain stability in their jobs.  </p>
                      		<p>Even though my experience of working remotely is from a desk in my flat and not Hanoi, it has me considering a career in IT and how I could expand my role within Aussie Broadband, or even shape a future career around the lifestyle I enjoy, that is challenging, interesting  and secure.  </p>
                          		<p> I started to take free Programming courses through EDX and Code Academy, as I had always found programming languages interesting and engaging. When the Federal government announced the COVID-19 Undergraduate Certificate courses, I saw that RMIT was offering an Undergraduate certificate in Information Technology. Having been a student at RMIT before, it seemed a natural fit to jump back into higher education to start exploring my options for a career in IT. I am hoping this certificate will give me a broad base of IT knowledge, and better idea of what my options could be moving forward. </p>

        <p>My project idea is for a series of banking tools and systems, with the purpose of simplifying the use of cryptocurrency in everyday life, to help encourage more widespread adoption of this technology. Ideally, this would be developed in conjunction with an existing financial institution, and integrated into their existing services, however it would potentially work as a stand-alone platform if required.   </p>
